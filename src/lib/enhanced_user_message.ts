export const ENHANCED_USER_MESSAGE = `⚠️ CRITICAL DEFECT INSPECTION - DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP ⚠️

🔴 PRIORITY 0A: PROTECTIVE CASE/SLEEVE DETECTION
**CRITICAL - CHECK THIS FIRST:**
- Look for ANY protective covering: penny sleeve, top loader, semi-rigid holder, slab
- Penny sleeves appear as CLEAR PLASTIC with visible edges/seams around the card
- Top loaders are rigid plastic cases with open top
- Semi-rigids are stiff plastic holders
- Slabs are professionally sealed hard cases (PSA, BGS, CGC, etc.)
- If card is in ANY case/sleeve → Set case_detection.case_type to the appropriate value
- Document case presence in image_quality.notes: "Card in [case type] - may affect defect visibility"
- Penny sleeves especially can obscure fine defects and create glare

🔴 PRIORITY 0B: IMAGE QUALITY - CORNER VISIBILITY CHECK
BEFORE GRADING: Verify ALL 8 corners (4 front + 4 back) are FULLY VISIBLE in frame.
- Corner is "CUT OFF" if tip extends beyond frame or touches image border
- If ANY corner cut off → Image Quality grade "C" (±0.5) - document which corners in notes
- If 2+ corners cut off → Image Quality grade "D" (±1.0)
- NEVER assign grade "A" or "B" if ANY corner is cut off

🔴 PRIORITY 1: UNVERIFIED AUTOGRAPH CHECK (GRADE: N/A - ALTERATION)
**CRITICAL - CHECK THIS FIRST BEFORE GRADING:**
- Look for ANY handwritten signature, autograph, or ink writing on front or back
- If you see an AUTOGRAPH (handwritten signature with player name/initials):
  → Check for manufacturer authentication: hologram, foil stamp, "Certified Autograph" text, serial number
  → If NO authentication markers visible → ❌ AUTOMATIC GRADE 1.0 (Altered - unverified autograph)
  → If authentication IS visible → Card is gradable normally
- ❌ NEVER grade an unverified autograph higher than 1.0
- Common unverified autographs: Signatures obtained in-person, through-the-mail, or added post-production without manufacturer certification

🔴 PRIORITY 2: CREASES & STRUCTURAL DAMAGE (GRADE CAP: 4.0 OR LOWER)
- Scan ENTIRE card surface (front and back) for ANY visible lines, folds, or indentations
- Look for BENT CORNERS (corners that don't lie flat, appear raised or deformed)
- Check for SURFACE CREASES (any line visible from reflected light, especially mid-card)
- Examine card at ANGLES to catch light reflection that reveals creases
- ❌ If you find ANY crease or bent corner → AUTOMATIC MAX GRADE 4.0
- Common locations: Mid-card horizontal creases, corner bends, diagonal folds

🔴 PRIORITY 3: HANDWRITTEN MARKINGS (NON-AUTOGRAPH)
- Check BOTH sides (especially back) for ANY pen, pencil, or marker writing
- Numbers, letters, symbols, prices (e.g., "100", "$5", initials)
- ❌ Any handwritten marking → AUTOMATIC GRADE 1.0

🔴 PRIORITY 4: EDGE DEFECTS - SYSTEMATIC SCAN (ALL 4 EDGES)
**⚠️ YOU MUST EXAMINE EVERY EDGE - DO NOT ASSUME PERFECTION ⚠️**

**📊 STATISTICAL REALITY - EXPECTED FINDINGS:**
- 60-70% of cards have edge defects on BOTTOM edge (most common location)
- 40-50% of cards have edge defects on TOP edge
- 30-40% of cards have edge defects on LEFT/RIGHT edges
- ⚠️ **IF YOU FIND ZERO EDGE DEFECTS → YOU ARE MISSING THEM - Re-examine immediately**

**🔍 WHAT EDGE DEFECTS LOOK LIKE - VISUAL IDENTIFICATION GUIDE:**

**Type 1: Micro White Dots** (MOST commonly missed - 50-60% of all edge defects)
- Appearance: Tiny bright pinpoint spots (0.05-0.15mm diameter, 1-3 pixels at high resolution)
- Location: ON the edge line (not on surface, but at the physical edge where border meets cut)
- Visibility by border color:
  * BLACK/DARK NAVY borders → Appear as BRIGHT WHITE dots (EASIEST to see - like tiny stars)
  * DARK BLUE borders → Appear as light blue or white micro-spots
  * DARK RED/BURGUNDY borders → Appear as pink or light spots
  * YELLOW/GOLD borders → Appear as very light yellow or white spots
  * WHITE borders → HARDEST - look for slightly brighter areas or texture changes
- Pattern: Usually appear as isolated single dots OR clusters of 2-4 micro-dots
- Visual cue: Create "sparkle" effect - micro-dots catch light like tiny pinpoints
- **Even ONE micro white dot disqualifies 10.0 grade**

**Type 2: Continuous Whitening** (Linear white bands)
- Appearance: Linear light bands or lines running along edge (like thin white stripe)
- Detection: Compare edge color to border color 1-2mm inward - is edge lighter?
- Width: 0.1-0.5mm wide band
- Length: Can range from 2mm to entire edge length
- Most visible on dark-colored borders (black, navy, dark blue, dark red)

**Type 3: Edge Chipping** (Missing material)
- Appearance: Irregular edge profile, "notches" or "dents" in edge line
- Detection: Edge line is NOT smooth/straight - has jagged sections
- Result: Exposes lighter card stock underneath colored border
- Size: 0.1-1mm+ indentations into edge

**Type 4: Edge Roughness** (Uneven texture)
- Appearance: Uneven or jagged edge line (not smooth)
- Detection: Zoom in and trace edge line - does it wobble or have micro-variations?
- Cause: Factory cutting variance OR handling wear

**🔬 MANDATORY SYSTEMATIC EDGE SCAN - FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCEDURE:**

**STEP 1: BOTTOM EDGE** 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY 🔴
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 55 seconds minimum

1. **Mental Setup:** ZOOM IN on bottom edge, prepare for segment-by-segment scan
2. **Divide edge into 5 EQUAL segments** (left to right):

   **Segment B1 (Bottom-Left, near corner):**
   - Scan for 8 seconds
   - Check for: white dots, whitening, chipping, roughness

   **Segment B2 (Left-Center):** ⚠️ HIGH DEFECT ZONE
   - Scan for 12 seconds
   - This segment has defects on 40-50% of cards
   - Look specifically for micro white dots against border color

   **Segment B3 (Center):** ⚠️ HIGHEST DEFECT ZONE
   - Scan for 15 seconds
   - This segment has defects on 50-60% of cards
   - The MOST COMMON location for edge damage
   - If you find ZERO defects here, re-scan immediately

   **Segment B4 (Right-Center):** ⚠️ HIGH DEFECT ZONE
   - Scan for 12 seconds
   - Similar probability to B2

   **Segment B5 (Bottom-Right, near corner):**
   - Scan for 8 seconds
   - Check for: white dots, whitening, chipping, roughness

3. **FOR EACH SEGMENT, ACTIVELY LOOK FOR:**
   ✓ Micro white dots (tiny bright spots 0.05-0.15mm)
   ✓ Continuous whitening (light bands along edge)
   ✓ Edge chipping (missing material, irregular profile)
   ✓ Roughness (jagged or uneven edge line)
   ✓ Color deviation (lighter areas vs. expected border color)

4. **MANDATORY VALIDATION CHECK:**
   - Question: "Did I find ANY defects on bottom edge?"
   - If YES → Document all findings, proceed to STEP 2
   - If NO → ⚠️ **STOP - You are likely missing defects**
     * Re-scan segments B2, B3, B4 for 10 seconds each
     * Look specifically for micro white dots on dark borders
     * 70% of cards have bottom edge defects - finding zero is statistically rare

**STEP 2: TOP EDGE** 🟡 SECOND PRIORITY
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 40 seconds minimum

1. ZOOM IN on top edge
2. SCAN LEFT TO RIGHT, dividing into 5 segments (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5)
3. Spend 8-12 seconds per segment
4. Check for SAME defect types as bottom edge:
   ✓ Micro white dots
   ✓ Continuous whitening
   ✓ Edge chipping
   ✓ Roughness
5. **NOTE:** Top edges are often damaged but frequently missed - be thorough

**STEP 3: LEFT EDGE** 🟢 MODERATE PRIORITY
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 25-40 seconds

1. ZOOM IN on left edge
2. SCAN TOP TO BOTTOM, dividing into 5 segments (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)
3. Spend 5-8 seconds per segment
4. Check for SAME defect types

**STEP 4: RIGHT EDGE** 🟢 MODERATE PRIORITY
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 25-40 seconds

1. ZOOM IN on right edge
2. SCAN TOP TO BOTTOM, dividing into 5 segments (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5)
3. Spend 5-8 seconds per segment
4. Check for SAME defect types

**STEP 5: ALL 8 CORNERS** (Front: TL, TR, BL, BR; Back: TL, TR, BL, BR)
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 80-110 seconds (10-15 sec per corner)

For EACH of the 8 corners, perform this inspection:

1. **ZOOM IN to corner tip** (the exact apex where two edges meet at 90° angle)

2. **CHECK FOR THESE SPECIFIC DEFECTS:**
   ✓ **Micro whitening (<0.1mm):** Tiny white dot at tip - appears as pinpoint bright spot
   ✓ **Minor whitening (0.1-0.3mm):** Small visible white area at tip
   ✓ **Moderate whitening (0.3-1mm):** Obvious white stock exposure
   ✓ **Heavy whitening (>1mm):** Extensive white exposure or rounding
   ✓ **Rounding:** Corner no longer sharp 90° angle, appears blunted/curved
   ✓ **Bent corner:** Corner raised/lifted, doesn't lie flat ← **AUTOMATIC 4.0 CAP**

3. **TIME ALLOCATION PER CORNER:**
   - **BOTTOM CORNERS (BL, BR):** 10-15 seconds EACH
     * Highest damage probability (60-70% have defects)
     * Most common: micro whitening at tip
   - **TOP CORNERS (TL, TR):** 8-12 seconds EACH
     * Moderate damage probability (40-50% have defects)

4. **DETECTION TIP FOR MICRO CORNER WHITENING:**
   - Focus on the EXACT tip where edges meet
   - Compare tip color to edge color 1mm away - is tip lighter?
   - On dark borders: Micro whitening appears as bright white dot
   - Look for "sparkle" effect at corner tip

**❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**

1. ❌ "Edges look good" without systematic segment-by-segment scan
2. ❌ Glancing at edges instead of methodical 5-segment inspection per edge
3. ❌ Missing micro white dots because they seem "too small to matter"
   - They DO matter: Even one 0.1mm dot disqualifies 10.0 grade
4. ❌ Confusing glare/reflection with actual edge defect
   - Solution: Compare to opposite edge to verify
5. ❌ Only checking corners and ignoring edge segments between corners
6. ❌ Scanning too quickly when card "looks perfect"
   - When card looks mint, you unconsciously scan FASTER and MISS micro-defects
   - Counter-measure: Force yourself to scan SLOWER on perfect-looking cards

**✅ PROPER DEFECT DOCUMENTATION EXAMPLES:**

GOOD - Specific and Measurable:
✅ "Bottom edge segment B3 (center): 4 micro white dots visible (0.1mm each) against black border - appear as bright pinpoint spots creating sparkle effect"
✅ "Top edge segment T2: Continuous whitening band 8mm length, 0.2mm width - light blue exposure along dark blue border edge"
✅ "Bottom-left corner: Moderate whitening 0.5mm at corner tip - white card stock visible against navy border"
✅ "Right edge segment R4: Edge chipping 0.3mm creating irregular notched profile - missing border material exposing lighter stock"
✅ "Bottom-right corner: Micro whitening <0.1mm at apex - tiny white dot visible where edges meet, appears as pinpoint bright spot on black border"

BAD - Vague and Unmeasurable:
❌ "Edge looks worn"
❌ "Some whitening visible"
❌ "Possible edge defect"
❌ "Minor corner wear"

**⚠️ CRITICAL VALIDATION - BEFORE PROCEEDING TO PRIORITY 5:**

Ask yourself these questions:
1. Did I scan ALL 4 edges in 5-segment pattern? (20 segments front, 20 segments back = 40 total)
2. Did I find ANY edge defects on bottom edge? (70% probability - finding zero is rare)
3. Did I examine ALL 8 corners for micro whitening? (70-80% have some corner whitening)
4. Did I spend adequate time? (Minimum 150-200 seconds for complete edge+corner inspection)

If you answer NO to any question → RE-EXAMINE before proceeding

**⚠️ STATISTICAL REALITY CHECK:**
- Finding ZERO edge defects across all edges = <5% probability (extremely rare)
- Finding ZERO corner defects across 8 corners = <20% probability (rare)
- If you're reporting zero defects on edges AND corners → **YOU ARE MISSING THEM**

🔴 PRIORITY 5: SURFACE DEFECTS - SCAN FRONT AND BACK COMPLETELY
**⚠️ SCAN ENTIRE SURFACE - DO NOT JUST GLANCE ⚠️**

**📊 STATISTICAL REALITY - EXPECTED FINDINGS:**
- 50-60% of cards have surface white dots/print defects
- 30-40% of cards have visible scratches
- 20-30% of cards have print defects (dots, lines, hickeys)
- ⚠️ **IF YOU FIND ZERO SURFACE DEFECTS → YOU ARE LIKELY MISSING THEM - Re-examine**

**🔍 WHAT SURFACE DEFECTS LOOK LIKE - VISUAL IDENTIFICATION GUIDE:**

**Type 1: Surface White Dots/Spots** (MOST commonly missed - 40-50% of surface defects)
- Appearance: Small white or light-colored dots/spots on card FACE (NOT on edges)
- Size: 0.1-1mm diameter (print dots are usually 0.1-0.3mm)
- Location: Can appear ANYWHERE on surface, most common in bottom third
- Visibility: Most visible on darker backgrounds, solid colors, or uniform areas
- Visual cue: Appear as isolated light spots against background
- Detection tip: Easier to see on solid color zones than busy graphics
- **Even ONE surface white dot disqualifies 10.0 grade**

**Type 2: Print Dots** (Factory manufacturing defects)
- Appearance: Tiny white dots in printed areas (0.1-0.3mm diameter)
- Cause: Missing ink from printing process, dust on printing plate
- Pattern: Usually isolated single dots, occasionally clusters
- Location: Most common on solid color backgrounds
- **PSA 10 ALLOWANCE:** Single tiny print dot <0.3mm in non-critical area (border/background) MAY allow 10.0 if doesn't impair appeal
- **NO 10.0 if:** Dot >0.3mm OR on critical area (player face, main subject) OR multiple dots

**Type 3: Scratches**
- **Hairline scratches:** <0.2mm wide, <5mm long
  * Barely visible, only seen when light reflects at certain angles
  * Catch light and create thin reflective line
  * Maximum grade impact: 9.5
- **Visible scratches:** ≥0.2mm wide OR ≥5mm long
  * Clearly visible, disrupt surface
  * Catch light easily, create obvious linear marks
  * Maximum grade impact: 9.0 to 8.5 depending on severity

**Type 4: Print Defects**
- **Print lines:** Roller marks, ink streaks, drag lines (horizontal or vertical)
- **Hickeys:** Circular printing defects, donut/ring shapes (0.5-2mm diameter)
- **Registration errors:** Color layer misalignment, ghost images, rainbow halos
- **Missing ink:** Areas where ink didn't adhere properly

**Type 5: Stains & Discoloration**
- Wax stains (from wax pack storage)
- Water damage/moisture marks
- Yellowing (aging, UV exposure)
- Ink marks or foreign substances
- Adhesive residue

**Type 6: Surface Damage** (STRUCTURAL - automatic grade caps)
- **Dents/Indentations:** Depressed areas in card surface → Grade cap ≤4.0
- **Creases:** Fold lines that break surface continuity → Grade cap ≤4.0
- **Abrasion patches:** Loss of glossy finish, dull/matte patches

**🔬 MANDATORY SYSTEMATIC SURFACE SCAN - FOLLOW THIS EXACT PROCEDURE:**

**SURFACE GRID SYSTEM:**
Mentally divide EACH card side (front and back) into 9 zones (3x3 grid):

+----------+----------+----------+
| Zone 1   | Zone 2   | Zone 3   |  <- Top Row
+----------+----------+----------+
| Zone 4   | Zone 5   | Zone 6   |  <- Middle Row (Zone 5 = Center)
+----------+----------+----------+
| Zone 7   | Zone 8   | Zone 9   |  <- Bottom Row
+----------+----------+----------+
  Left       Center     Right

**TOTAL ZONES TO INSPECT:** 18 (9 front + 9 back)

**STEP 1: FRONT SURFACE - 9-ZONE SCAN**
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 90-140 seconds

For EACH zone, perform systematic inspection:

**Zone 5 (Center)** 🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Time: 15-20 seconds
- Contains main subject (player face on sports cards, character on TCG)
- Scratches here dramatically impact card appeal
- Check for: white dots, scratches, print defects, stains
- **ANY visible defect in Zone 5 = significant grade impact**

**Zones 2, 4, 6, 8 (Cardinal zones surrounding center)** 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY
- Time: 8-12 seconds EACH (32-48 seconds total)
- Check for: white dots, scratches, print defects, stains
- Solid color backgrounds → Add 5 seconds (defects MOST visible)

**Zones 1, 3, 7, 9 (Corner zones)** 🟢 MODERATE PRIORITY
- Time: 5-8 seconds EACH (20-32 seconds total)
- Check for: white dots, scratches, print defects, stains
- Pay special attention if solid color background

**FOR EACH ZONE, ACTIVELY LOOK FOR:**
✓ **Surface white dots:** Isolated light spots 0.1-1mm (NOT on edge, on surface)
✓ **Print dots:** Tiny white dots in printed areas 0.1-0.3mm
✓ **Scratches:** Hairline (<0.2mm) or visible (≥0.2mm) linear marks
✓ **Print defects:** Lines, hickeys (donuts), registration errors
✓ **Stains:** Discoloration, yellowing, wax marks, water damage
✓ **Surface damage:** Dents, indentations (CRITICAL - 4.0 cap)
✓ **Abrasion:** Dull patches, loss of gloss

**STEP 2: BACK SURFACE - 9-ZONE SCAN**
⏱️ TIME REQUIRED: 90-140 seconds

Repeat the EXACT SAME 9-zone inspection procedure for the back:
- Zone 5 (Center): 15-20 seconds
- Zones 2, 4, 6, 8: 8-12 seconds each
- Zones 1, 3, 7, 9: 5-8 seconds each

**DETECTION TIPS FOR SURFACE DEFECTS:**

1. **Best visibility for white dots/print dots:**
   - Solid color backgrounds (easiest to see defects)
   - Dark backgrounds (white dots appear as bright spots)
   - Uniform areas (defects stand out against consistency)

2. **Best visibility for scratches:**
   - Observe at different angles (scratches catch light)
   - Glossy surfaces (scratches break reflectivity)
   - Light-colored areas (scratches create shadow lines)

3. **Most common locations for surface white dots:**
   - Bottom third of card (40-50% of surface defects)
   - Solid color background areas
   - Border zones (especially white borders)

4. **Protective case artifacts - DO NOT count against card:**
   - Case scratches appear on OUTER layer (not card itself)
   - Scratch spans both card AND holder edge = case artifact
   - Multiple parallel scratches from case handling = case defects
   - Document: "Card grade based on visible card only, case shows scratches"

**✅ PROPER DEFECT DOCUMENTATION EXAMPLES:**

GOOD - Specific and Measurable:
✅ "Front Zone 5 (center): Surface white dot 0.2mm diameter on dark blue background - appears as isolated bright spot"
✅ "Front Zone 8 (bottom center): 3 print dots clustered together, each 0.1mm, on solid red background"
✅ "Back Zone 4: Hairline scratch 4mm length, <0.1mm width - catches light at angle, runs vertically through text area"
✅ "Front Zone 2: Print hickey (donut shape) 1.2mm diameter on yellow background - visible ring pattern"
✅ "Back Zone 7: Small wax stain 2mm diameter in bottom-left border area - slight yellowing visible"

BAD - Vague and Unmeasurable:
❌ "Some surface wear"
❌ "Card looks clean"
❌ "Possible print defect"
❌ "Minor surface issues"

**❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**

1. ❌ "Surface looks clean" without zone-by-zone inspection
2. ❌ Only examining the center/player face and ignoring background/border zones
3. ❌ Missing print dots because they're "just manufacturing variance"
   - They DO matter for grading accuracy
4. ❌ Counting case scratches against the card grade
   - Only grade the CARD, not the protective case
5. ❌ Scanning too quickly when surface appears glossy/clean
   - Glossy surfaces can still have microscopic defects
6. ❌ Missing white dots on solid color backgrounds
   - These are the EASIEST defects to see - scan carefully

**⚠️ CRITICAL VALIDATION - BEFORE FINALIZING GRADE:**

Ask yourself these questions:
1. Did I scan ALL 18 zones (9 front + 9 back)?
2. Did I spend adequate time on Zone 5 center areas? (15-20 seconds each)
3. Did I check solid color backgrounds extra carefully? (defects most visible)
4. Did I find ANY surface defects? (50-60% probability for white dots/print defects)
5. Did I spend adequate time? (Minimum 180-280 seconds for complete surface inspection)

If you answer NO to any question → RE-EXAMINE before finalizing grade

**⚠️ STATISTICAL REALITY CHECK:**
- Finding ZERO surface defects on both front and back = <40% probability
- Finding ZERO white dots on solid color backgrounds = <50% probability
- If reporting zero surface defects on card with large solid color areas → **LIKELY MISSING THEM**

**⚠️ GRADE 10.0 REALITY CHECK:**

Before assigning grade 10.0 to corners, edges, OR surface:

**GRADE 10.0 REQUIREMENTS - ALL must be true:**
✓ ZERO corner defects on all 8 corners (no micro whitening)
✓ ZERO edge defects on all 40 edge segments (no micro white dots)
✓ ZERO surface defects on all 18 zones (may allow single tiny print dot <0.3mm in non-critical area per PSA)
✓ Perfect centering (50/50 or 51/49)
✓ Zero structural damage

**STATISTICAL REALITY:**
- Grade 10.0 is EXCEPTIONALLY RARE (<1% of all cards)
- Even "perfect-looking" cards usually have 9.5 due to microscopic manufacturing variance
- 70-80% of cards have corner whitening somewhere
- 60-70% of cards have bottom edge defects
- 50-60% of cards have surface white dots

**⚠️ IF ASSIGNING 10.0 TO ANY CATEGORY:**
1. STOP immediately
2. RE-EXAMINE that category at highest scrutiny
3. Specifically look for microscopic defects you may have missed
4. Remember: Missing defects = inflated grades = user dissatisfaction
5. When uncertain between 9.5 and 10.0 → ALWAYS choose 9.5 (safety default)

⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- If you detect an UNVERIFIED AUTOGRAPH → Grade 1.0 (Altered)
- If you detect a CREASE or BENT CORNER → Maximum grade 4.0
- If you detect HANDWRITTEN MARKING → Grade 1.0 (Altered)
- If you detect ANY edge/corner defect → Card is NOT a 10.0
- If you detect ANY surface white dot on critical area → Card is NOT a 10.0
- Grade 10.0 is <1% of cards - most high-quality cards are 9.0-9.5
- Be APPROPRIATELY CRITICAL - look for defects, don't assume perfection
- ASSUME DEFECTS EXIST UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE
