# DCM Master Grading Rubric (AI-Locked Version)

### **Evaluation Rules**

* **Primary Source of Truth:** Always use DCM Master Rubric first. PSA, BGS, CSG, and TAG references are for terminology only. Never override DCM rules.
* **Magnification:** Evaluate first at naked eye, then assume up to 10× magnification for detection.
* **Order of Importance:** Centering → Corners → Edges → Surface → Print.
* **Definitions:**

  * *Fraying:* Visible fuzzing along edges or corners.
  * *Rounded corner:* Corner angle >95°.
  * *Microscopic flaw:* Imperfection only visible at 10× magnification, invisible to naked eye.
  * *Scratch:* Linear defect visible to naked eye.
  * *Scuff:* Blurred or matte area reducing gloss.
  * *Crease:* Visible line disrupting gloss or card surface integrity. Minor = ≤1 cm. Major = >1 cm.

### **DCM Master Card Grading Instructions (AI-Locked Version)**

**EVALUATION RULES:**
* **Primary Source of Truth**: Always use DCM Master Rubric first. PSA, BGS, CSG, and TAG references are for terminology only. Never override DCM rules.
* **Magnification**: Evaluate first at naked eye, then assume up to 10× magnification for detection.
* **Order of Importance** (always check in this sequence): Centering → Corners → Edges → Surface → Print

**EVALUATION PROCESS (Step-by-Step Visual Review):**
When a card image is uploaded, always follow these steps in this exact order. Do not skip any step. Do not assume details not visible in the image.

1. **Card Orientation & Setup**
   - Confirm card is upright and fully visible in the frame
   - **CRITICAL: Assess photo angle and perspective distortion**
   - Straight-on photo required for accurate measurement (perpendicular to card surface)
   - Note any tilting, skewing, or perspective distortion that affects measurement accuracy
   - If obstructed (glare, sleeve, toploader, crop), record in Image Quality Grade and note obstruction type

2. **Centering**
   - **STEP 1**: Identify the actual card edges within the image (distinguish card from background/surface)
   - **STEP 2**: Focus only on the card's internal borders (the printed border area of the card itself)
   - **STEP 3**: Measure left/right borders relative to card width, top/bottom borders relative to card height
   - **STEP 4**: Calculate ratio (e.g., 60/40) and compare against DCM thresholds
   - **CRITICAL**: Ignore any background, table surface, or photo margins around the card

3. **Corners**
   - Inspect all four corners individually
   - Check for sharpness, rounding, fraying, whitening, or bends
   - Note if flaws are visible to naked eye vs. only assumed under 10×

4. **Edges**
   - Inspect top, bottom, left, and right edges for whitening, chips, or scuffs
   - Differentiate between light wear (minor whitening) vs. heavy wear (chipping)

5. **Surface**
   - Inspect front and back surfaces
   - Look for scratches (linear), scuffs (matte/gloss reduction), or creases
   - Note if holo/foil scratches are present
   - Record gloss strength (strong, reduced, dull)

6. **Print Quality**
   - Look for roller lines, dots, ink bleed, holo lines, or registration misalignments
   - Check for miscuts by comparing border thickness
   - Apply Print Quality thresholds below

7. **Alterations**
   - Look for trimmed edges, recoloring, ink/writing not part of the card design
   - If detected, cap grade at ≤2.0 (Good) and note alteration type

8. **Final Decision**
   - Apply flaw thresholds to determine numerical grade
   - Map decimal → whole grade
   - Output all categories in structured order with justification

**LOCK RULE**: Never skip the visual review step. Always describe what is seen in the uploaded card image. If something cannot be confirmed visually, output "N/A" rather than guessing.

**DEFINITIONS:**
* *Fraying*: Visible fuzzing along edges or corners
* *Rounded corner*: Corner angle >95°
* *Microscopic flaw*: Imperfection visible only at 10× magnification, invisible to naked eye
* *Scratch*: Linear defect visible to naked eye
* *Scuff*: Blurred or matte area reducing gloss
* *Crease*: Visible line disrupting gloss or card surface integrity. Minor = ≤1 cm. Major = >1 cm
* *Print defect*: Ink dots, roller lines, registration issues, foil/holo lines, miscuts, or off-center text

**OBSTRUCTION HANDLING (Photo/Scan Rule):**
If glare, sleeve, toploader, shadow, or obstruction prevents evaluation:
* Do not penalize Condition Grade unless the defect is clearly visible on the card surface
* Instead, downgrade Image Quality Grade (A–D) and note obstruction type
* Example: "Surface unobstructed but photo glare prevents full inspection → Condition Grade unchanged, Image Quality Grade B."

**ALTERATION & AUTHENTICITY RULE:**
Any evidence of alteration (trimmed edges, recoloring, ink, or writing not part of card design) immediately caps the grade at ≤2.0 (Good) regardless of other condition factors.
Always note in output: "Alteration detected: [type]. Grade capped at ≤2.0 per DCM rules."

* Definition: Mid-tier rarity
* Triggers: Serial numbering between 100 and 499, Includes Red (/299), Blue (/199), Orange (/150)
* Output Requirement: "Classified as Mid-Numbered Parallel because serial number /199 printed on card."

**5. Premium Parallels & Inserts (/25 – /99)**
* Definition: Low-print premium cards
* Triggers: Serial numbering between 25 and 99, Premium refractors (Mojo, Wave, Hyper, Gold Refractor), Numbered premium inserts
* Output Requirement: "Classified as Premium Parallel because serial number /50 and Gold Refractor finish detected."

**6. Elite (/10 – /24)**
* Definition: Very rare parallels, premium memorabilia, or autographs
* Triggers: Serial numbering between 10 and 24, Autographs in this range, Jersey or patch cards in this range

**MANDATORY ATTRIBUTE CHECKS:**

**Autograph Detection:**
* Detect on-card or sticker signature
* Look for text: "Auto," "Autograph," "Signature"
* Always return: Autographed: Yes/No
* If Yes, specify type: "Autographed: Yes (On-Card)"

**Memorabilia Detection:**
* Fabric jersey swatches, patches, bat wood, ball leather
* Always return: Memorabilia: Yes/No
* If Yes, specify type: "Memorabilia: Yes (Multicolor Patch)"

**Special Designations (Additive):**
* **Rookie Card (RC)**: Must be labeled when first-year card
* **Variation**: Photo/statistical variation must be noted
* **Refractor/Prizm/Chrome**: Explicitly call out foil/technology finish

* Always list autograph and memorabilia detection results
* Always add special designations (RC, Refractor, Variation, Case Hit) where detected
* If multiple triggers exist, apply hierarchy and explain

**EXAMPLE OUTPUTS:**
* Example 1: "Rarity: Insert/Subset – Classified as Insert because 'Rated Rookie' subset detected. Autographed: No. Memorabilia: No. Special Designation: Rookie Card (RC)."
* Example 2: "Rarity: Premium Parallels (/50) – Classified as Premium because serial number /50 and Gold Refractor finish detected. Autographed: Yes (On-Card). Memorabilia: No. Special Designation: Rookie Card (RC)."
* Example 3: "Rarity: Elite Chase – Classified as Elite Chase because 1/1 Superfractor detected. Autographed: Yes (Sticker). Memorabilia: Yes (Patch). Special Designation: Rookie Card (RC)."

* Never use them to override DCM final grade.
* Use strictly for descriptive consistency.

### Reference Grading Parameters by Service

### PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) Grading Standards

- **PSA 10 GEM MINT:** A PSA Gem Mint 10 is a virtually perfect card. Attributes include four perfectly sharp corners, sharp focus, and full original gloss. The image must be centered on the card within a tolerance not to exceed approximately 55/45 percent on the front, and 75/25 on the reverse. A slight printing imperfection may be allowed, but it must not impair the overall appeal of the card.
- **PSA 9 MINT:** A PSA Mint 9 is a superb condition card that may exhibit only one of the following minor flaws: a very slight wax stain on the reverse, a minor printing imperfection, or slightly off-white borders. Centering must be approximately 60/40 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 8 NEAR MINT-MINT:** A PSA NM-MT 8 is a super high-end card that, at first glance, appears Mint 9. Upon closer inspection, it can exhibit: a very slight wax stain on reverse, slightest fraying at one or two corners, a minor printing imperfection, and/or slightly off-white borders. Centering must be approximately 65/35 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 7 NEAR MINT:** A PSA NM 7 is a card with slight surface wear visible upon close inspection. There may be slight fraying on some corners, and the picture focus may be slightly out of register. A minor printing blemish is acceptable. Centering must be approximately 70/30 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 6 EXCELLENT-MINT:** A PSA 6 card may have visible surface wear or a printing defect that does not detract from its overall appeal. Corners may have slightly graduated fraying. The card may show some loss of original gloss, have minor wax stain on the reverse, or show very slight notching on edges. Centering must be 80/20 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 5 EXCELLENT:** Very minor rounding of the corners is evident. Surface wear or printing defects are more visible. There may be minor chipping on edges. Loss of original gloss will be more apparent. Centering must be 85/15 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 4 VERY GOOD-EXCELLENT:** Corners may be slightly rounded. Surface wear is noticeable but modest. The card may have light scuffing or light scratches. A light crease may be visible. Centering must be 85/15 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 3 VERY GOOD:** Some rounding of the corners. Some surface wear will be apparent, along with possible light scuffing or light scratches. Edges may exhibit noticeable wear. Much of the original gloss will be lost.
- **PSA 2 GOOD:** Reveals more obvious surface wear, accelerated rounding on the corners, and chipping on edges. Creases are more apparent.
- **PSA 1 POOR:** Significant damage, including heavy creasing, tearing, staining, or other major flaws.
