# DCM Master Grading Assistant - Complete Instructions

# DCM Master Grading Rubric (AI-Locked Version)

### **Evaluation Rules**

* **Primary Source of Truth:** Always use DCM Master Rubric first. PSA, BGS, CSG, and TAG references are for terminology only. Never override DCM rules.
* **Magnification:** Evaluate first at naked eye, then assume up to 10× magnification for detection.
* **Order of Importance:** Centering → Corners → Edges → Surface → Print.
* **Definitions:**

  * *Fraying:* Visible fuzzing along edges or corners.
  * *Rounded corner:* Corner angle >95°.
  * *Microscopic flaw:* Imperfection only visible at 10× magnification, invisible to naked eye.
  * *Scratch:* Linear defect visible to naked eye.
  * *Scuff:* Blurred or matte area reducing gloss.
  * *Crease:* Visible line disrupting gloss or card surface integrity. Minor = ≤1 cm. Major = >1 cm.

### **Sports Card Rarity Scale**

**1. Common (Base)**
* Standard cards in the base set.
* No serial numbering, no parallels, no inserts.
* Printed in high volume.

**2. Uncommon (Parallel / Short Print)**
* Parallel versions of base cards (e.g., Silver, Refractor, Holofoil).
* Short prints (SP) or variations (photo/pose changes).
* Typically lower print runs but not serial numbered.

**3. Rare (Serial Numbered)**
* Cards with serial numbering (e.g., /999, /499, /299).
* Considered rarer than parallels due to defined print run.

**4. Very Rare (Low Serial / Special Insert)**
* Serial numbers ≤100 (e.g., /99, /50, /25).
* Special themed inserts with limited production.

**5. Ultra Rare (Premium Relic / Autograph)**
* Autographs, relics (jersey patches, bat pieces, ball swatches).
* Serial numbering ≤25 typical.

**6. Super Rare (Case Hit / 1-of-1)**
* 1/1 cards, printing plates, superfractors, "case hit" chase inserts.
* Unique production, highest collector value.

---

### **Obstruction Handling**

* Always label obstruction severity (Minor, Moderate, Major).
* Always explain what is obstructed: e.g., "Top border glare, centering unobstructed."
* Reduce confidence score (A → B → C → D) according to severity.
* Never guess hidden details. Use "Obstructed" or "N/A."

* Never use them to override DCM final grade.
* Use strictly for descriptive consistency.

### Reference Grading Parameters by Service

### PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) Grading Standards

- **PSA 10 GEM MINT:** A PSA Gem Mint 10 is a virtually perfect card. Attributes include four perfectly sharp corners, sharp focus, and full original gloss. The image must be centered on the card within a tolerance not to exceed approximately 55/45 percent on the front, and 75/25 on the reverse. A slight printing imperfection may be allowed, but it must not impair the overall appeal of the card.
- **PSA 9 MINT:** A PSA Mint 9 is a superb condition card that may exhibit only one of the following minor flaws: a very slight wax stain on the reverse, a minor printing imperfection, or slightly off-white borders. Centering must be approximately 60/40 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 8 NEAR MINT-MINT:** A PSA NM-MT 8 is a super high-end card that, at first glance, appears Mint 9. Upon closer inspection, it can exhibit: a very slight wax stain on reverse, slightest fraying at one or two corners, a minor printing imperfection, and/or slightly off-white borders. Centering must be approximately 65/35 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 7 NEAR MINT:** A PSA NM 7 is a card with slight surface wear visible upon close inspection. There may be slight fraying on some corners, and the picture focus may be slightly out of register. A minor printing blemish is acceptable. Centering must be approximately 70/30 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 6 EXCELLENT-MINT:** A PSA 6 card may have visible surface wear or a printing defect that does not detract from its overall appeal. Corners may have slightly graduated fraying. The card may show some loss of original gloss, have minor wax stain on the reverse, or show very slight notching on edges. Centering must be 80/20 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the reverse.
- **PSA 5 EXCELLENT:** Very minor rounding of the corners is evident. Surface wear or printing defects are more visible. There may be minor chipping on edges. Loss of original gloss will be more apparent. Centering must be 85/15 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 4 VERY GOOD-EXCELLENT:** Corners may be slightly rounded. Surface wear is noticeable but modest. The card may have light scuffing or light scratches. A light crease may be visible. Centering must be 85/15 or better on the front and 90/10 or better on the back.
- **PSA 3 VERY GOOD:** Some rounding of the corners. Some surface wear will be apparent, along with possible light scuffing or light scratches. Edges may exhibit noticeable wear. Much of the original gloss will be lost.
- **PSA 2 GOOD:** Reveals more obvious surface wear, accelerated rounding on the corners, and chipping on edges. Creases are more apparent.
- **PSA 1 POOR:** Significant damage, including heavy creasing, tearing, staining, or other major flaws.

- **BGS Pristine 10 (Black Label):** The ultimate grade. All four subgrades (Centering, Corners, Edges, Surface) must be a 10. Centering is 50/50 all around on the front, 60/40 or better on the back. No visible flaws to the naked eye.
- **BGS Pristine 10 (Gold Label):** The card is perfect to the naked eye but misses the Black Label due to subgrades. May have a combination of 9.5 and 10 subgrades.
- **BGS Gem Mint 9.5:** This is a virtually flawless card. May have a few minor imperfections only visible under magnification. Centering must be 50/50 one way and 55/45 the other on the front, 60/40 or better on the back.
- **BGS Mint 9:** Centering must be 55/45 both ways on the front, 70/30 or better on the back. Corners are Mint upon close inspection, with a speck of wear allowed under intense scrutiny.
- **BGS NM-MT+ 8.5:** Centering is 60/40 or better on the front, 80/20 or better on the back. Corners are sharp to the naked eye, with slight imperfections under close examination.
- **BGS NM-MT 8:** Centering is 60/40 or better on the front, 80/20 or better on the back. Relational borders with minor chipping on edges. A few minor print spots are allowed.
- **BGS NM 7:** Centering is 65/35 or better on the front, 90/10 or better on the back. Very minor wear on two or three corners, slight roughness or minor chipping on edges.
