# Comprehensive Grading Scale (1.0 - 10.0)

## Problem Identified

Current severity scale only provides guidance for grades **8.0-10.0**, leaving AI without clear criteria for grades **7.0 and below**.

**Current Scale (Incomplete):**
- Microscopic (<0.1mm) → Max 9.5
- Minor (0.1-0.3mm) → Max 9.5
- Moderate (0.3-1mm) → Max 9.0-8.5
- Heavy (>1mm) → **Max 8.0 or lower** ← Vague, no specific guidance

**Result:** AI likely clusters grades in 8.0-9.5 range because that's where explicit criteria exist.

## Proposed: Complete 1-10 Grading Scale

Based on professional grading standards (PSA, BGS, SGC, CGC) and defect severity:

### **Grade 10.0 - Gem Mint (Perfect)**
**Defect Threshold:** ZERO defects on all categories

**Criteria:**
- All 8 corners: Perfect 90° angles, zero whitening (<0.05mm if any)
- All edges: Zero white dots, zero chipping, zero roughness
- Surface: Flawless gloss, zero scratches, zero print defects (front AND back)
- Centering: 50/50 to 55/45 on all four axes
- No protective case (raw card only)

**Frequency:** <1% of cards (extremely rare)

**Example:** Freshly pulled card, immediately sleeved, zero handling

---

### **Grade 9.5 - Gem Mint (Near Perfect)**
**Defect Threshold:** Microscopic defects only (individually <0.1mm)

**Criteria:**
- Corners: 1-2 corners with microscopic whitening (<0.1mm at tip)
- Edges: 1-3 isolated white dots (<0.1mm each)
- Surface: 1-2 microscopic print dots or hairline scratches
- Centering: 50/50 to 60/40
- Overall: Card appears perfect to naked eye, defects only visible under magnification

**Frequency:** 5-10% of cards

**Example:** Well-handled mint card, minimal manufacturing variance

---

### **Grade 9.0 - Mint**
**Defect Threshold:** Minor defects (0.1-0.3mm), visible upon close inspection

**Criteria:**
- Corners: 2-3 corners with minor whitening (0.1-0.3mm) OR 1 corner with moderate rounding
- Edges: Minor whitening on 1-2 edges (0.1-0.3mm continuous) OR 4-6 white dots
- Surface: Minor visible scratches (<5mm length) OR 3-5 small print defects
- Centering: 56/45 to 70/30
- Overall: High-quality card with visible minor flaws upon inspection

**Frequency:** 20-30% of cards

**Example:** Lightly played card, minimal wear, well-maintained

---

### **Grade 8.5 - Near Mint-Mint**
**Defect Threshold:** Moderate defects (0.3-1mm) on 1 component OR multiple minor defects

**Criteria:**
- Corners: 1 corner with moderate whitening (0.3-1mm) OR 3-4 corners with minor defects
- Edges: Moderate edge whitening on 1 edge (0.3-1mm) OR minor defects on multiple edges
- Surface: Moderate scratch visible to naked eye OR multiple minor scratches/print defects
- Centering: 56/45 to 75/25
- Overall: Noticeable wear on one area OR light wear across multiple areas

**Frequency:** 15-20% of cards

**Example:** Moderately played card, visible wear in one or two areas

---

### **Grade 8.0 - Near Mint**
**Defect Threshold:** Moderate defects (0.3-1mm) on multiple components OR 1 heavy defect

**Criteria:**

- Edges: Moderate whitening/chipping on 2-3 edges OR continuous edge wear
- Surface: Multiple moderate scratches OR 1 long visible scratch (>10mm)
- Centering: 61/39 to 75/25 (may trigger centering cap at 8.0)
- Overall: Clear visible wear across multiple areas

**Frequency:** 20-25% of cards

**Example:** Played card with obvious handling wear, multiple defect areas

---

### **Grade 7.0 - Near Mint (Lower End)**
**Defect Threshold:** Heavy defects (>1mm) on 1-2 components OR extensive moderate defects

**Criteria:**
- Corners: 1-2 corners with heavy whitening (>1mm) OR 3-4 corners with moderate whitening
- Edges: Heavy edge whitening/chipping (>1mm) on 1-2 edges OR moderate defects on all edges
- Surface: Heavy scratch (>15mm) OR multiple moderate scratches OR noticeable staining
- Centering: 71/29 to 85/15 (may trigger centering cap at 7.0-8.0)
- Overall: Significant visible wear, card still structurally sound

**Frequency:** 10-15% of cards

**Example:** Well-played card, obvious edge/corner wear, surface scratching visible

**Typical Defects:**

**Frequency:** 5-8% of cards

**Example:** Heavily played card, substantial corner/edge wear, noticeable surface damage

**Typical Defects:**
- Multiple corners with >1mm whitening and rounding
- Edge chipping creating "fuzzy" appearance along entire edge
- Surface scratches visible from arm's length
- Staining or discoloration affecting 5-10% of card surface
- Print defects (off-register, snow, roller lines)

---

### **Grade 5.0 - Excellent**
**Defect Threshold:** Extreme wear on multiple components, approaching structural compromise

**Criteria:**
- Corners: 3-4 corners with heavy whitening/rounding OR 1-2 corners with extreme damage (>2mm)
- Edges: All edges showing heavy whitening/chipping OR material loss on multiple edges
- Surface: Heavy scratches covering significant area OR staining affecting 10-20% of surface OR glossy finish loss
- Centering: ≥86/14 (may trigger centering cap at 5.0)
- Overall: Card shows extreme play wear, borders on structural issues but no creases/bends

**Frequency:** 3-5% of cards

**Example:** Extensively played card, heavy damage but no structural compromise

**Typical Defects:**
- All corners rounded with >1.5mm whitening
- Edges show material loss, appear "fuzzy" or "frayed"
- Surface scratches form visible patterns, card appears "dull"
- Staining, foxing, or discoloration covering significant area
- Loss of glossy finish (appears matte in areas)
- Border wear exposing white edge of card

**⚠️ Key Distinction:** Grade 5.0 is the LOWEST grade for cards without structural damage. Below this, cards have creases, bends, tears, or other structural compromise.

---

### **Grade 4.0 - Very Good-Excellent**
**Defect Threshold:** STRUCTURAL DAMAGE (crease, bent corner) OR extreme wear on all components

**Criteria - Structural Damage Path (Most Common):**
- **ANY crease** (fold line through paper, any size) → Automatic 4.0 cap
- **ANY bent corner** (raised/warped, does not lie flat) → Automatic 4.0 cap
- Card structure permanently compromised

**Criteria - Extreme Wear Path (Less Common):**
- Corners: All 4 corners with extreme damage (>2mm whitening, heavy rounding)
- Edges: Severe edge damage on all 4 edges, significant material loss
- Surface: Heavy scratching covering >30% of surface OR significant staining OR finish completely worn off in areas
- Centering: Extreme off-center (>90/10)

**Frequency:** 3-5% of cards

**Example:** Card with crease, bent corner, or extreme play wear

**Typical Defects:**
- **Crease:** Visible fold line with shadow/depth, paper fibers bent
- **Bent corner:** Corner raised/warped, doesn't lie flat on surface
- Heavy indentation or denting in card surface
- Extreme corner wear (all corners heavily damaged)

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Add Full Scale to Prompt (Recommended)

Add comprehensive 1-10 scale to the grading calculation section with clear examples for each grade.

**Pros:**
- AI has explicit criteria for ALL grades
- Reduces grade clustering in 8-10 range
- Improves accuracy for damaged cards

**Cons:**
- Adds ~500-700 lines to prompt (already 2500+ lines)
- May increase token usage

---

### Option 2: Simplified Reference Table

Add condensed reference table showing defect → grade mapping:

```
GRADE REFERENCE TABLE:
┌───────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Grade │ Typical Defects                                            │
├───────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 10.0  │ Zero defects (all categories perfect)                      │
│ 9.5   │ 1-2 microscopic defects (<0.1mm)                           │
│ 9.0   │ 2-3 minor defects (0.1-0.3mm)                              │
│ 8.5   │ 1 moderate defect (0.3-1mm) OR multiple minor              │
│ 8.0   │ 2+ moderate defects OR 1 heavy defect (>1mm)               │
│ 7.0   │ Heavy defects on multiple components                        │
│ 6.0   │ Extensive heavy defects, significant wear                   │
│ 5.0   │ Extreme wear (no structural damage)                         │
│ 4.0   │ Structural damage (crease, bent corner)                     │
│ 3.0   │ Multiple structural defects OR heavy crease                 │
│ 2.0   │ Severe damage (tears, major creasing)                       │
│ 1.0   │ Extreme damage (major tears, missing pieces)                │
└───────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pros:**
- Compact (adds ~100 lines)
- Quick reference for AI

**Cons:**
- Less detailed than full scale
- May not provide enough guidance for edge cases

---

### Option 3: Component-Specific Grade Tables

Create separate tables for Corners, Edges, and Surface showing 1-10 scoring:

**Example - Corner Scoring:**
```
CORNER COMPONENT SCORING (1-10):
- 10.0: All 8 corners perfect (zero defects)
- 9.5: 1-2 corners microscopic whitening (<0.1mm)
- 9.0: 2-3 corners minor whitening (0.1-0.3mm)
- 8.5: 3-4 corners minor defects OR 1 moderate (0.3-1mm)
- 8.0: 1-2 corners heavy whitening (>1mm) OR multiple moderate
- 7.0: 2-3 corners heavy defects OR all corners moderate wear
- 6.0: All corners heavy defects (>1mm whitening + rounding)
- 5.0: Extreme corner wear (>2mm whitening, heavy rounding)
- 4.0: Bent corner (structural damage) OR extreme damage all corners
- 3.0: Multiple bent corners OR corner splitting
- 2.0: Corner tears (2-5mm)
- 1.0: Corner torn off OR major tears
```

**Pros:**
- Provides specific component-level guidance
- Helps AI score individual components accurately

**Cons:**
- Adds ~300-400 lines (separate tables for corners, edges, surface)
- More complex structure

---

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1 (Full Scale) + Option 2 (Reference Table)**

1. Add condensed **Grade Reference Table** to Priority Level section (quick lookup)
2. Add **detailed 1-10 scale** to grading calculation section with examples
3. This provides both quick reference and detailed guidance

**Estimated addition:** ~800-1000 lines total
- Reference table: ~100 lines
- Detailed 1-10 scale: ~700-900 lines

**Current prompt:** 2509 lines (Stage 1)
**After addition:** ~3300-3500 lines

This is still manageable for Claude's context window and will significantly improve grading accuracy for cards below 8.0.

## Next Steps

1. Review proposed scale with you for accuracy
2. Add Grade Reference Table to prompts (both Stage 1 and Stage 2)
3. Add detailed grade descriptions to calculation sections
4. Test with cards across different grade ranges (10.0, 9.0, 7.0, 5.0, 4.0)
5. Verify AI now assigns appropriate grades below 8.0

**Should I proceed with implementing the comprehensive grading scale?**
