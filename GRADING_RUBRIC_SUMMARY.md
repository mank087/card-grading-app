## 📊 10-Point Grading Scale

Your grading system uses a 10-point numeric scale with corresponding condition labels:

| Numeric Range | Condition Label | Description |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **9.6–10.0** | **Gem Mint (GM)** | Perfect or near-perfect card |
| **9.0–9.5** | **Mint (M)** | Minimal manufacturing variance only |
| **8.0–8.9** | **Near Mint (NM)** | Minor wear or defects visible |
| **6.0–7.9** | **Excellent (EX)** | Noticeable wear or defects |
| **4.0–5.9** | **Good (G)** | Moderate damage present |
| **2.0–3.9** | **Fair (F)** | Heavy damage or wear |
| **1.0–1.9** | **Poor (P)** | Severe damage |
| **N/A** | **Authentic Altered (AA)** | Card has alterations (autographs, trimming, markings) |

**Distribution Expectations:**
- 10.0 grades should be **<1% of all submissions** (extremely rare)
- Most cards fall in the **8.0-9.5 range**
- Perfect 10.0 requires **ZERO visible defects** in all categories

---

## 🎯 Four Main Grading Categories

All cards are evaluated across four independent categories:

### 1. **Centering**
- Front and back evaluated **independently**
- Measured as left/right and top/bottom ratios
- Worst axis determines the centering score
- **Centering caps limit maximum possible grade** (see table below)

### 2. **Corners**
- All **4 corners** evaluated independently
- Each corner can have different defects
- Common issues: fiber exposure, softening, rounding, whitening
- Worst corner heavily influences final grade

### 3. **Edges**
- All **4 edges** evaluated independently
- Scanned for white flecks, whitening, roughness, chipping
- Even small white flecks trigger deductions
- Continuous edge whitening = heavy penalty

### 4. **Surface**
- Front and back surfaces evaluated separately
- Examined for: white dots, scratches, print defects, debris, indentations
- Holographic/refractor cards: pattern disruption is significant
- **ANY visible defect** prevents 10.0 grade

---

## 📏 Centering Caps (MANDATORY)

Centering ratio determines the **maximum possible grade** regardless of other factors:

| Centering Ratio | Description | **Maximum Grade** | Notes |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **50/50** | Perfect centering | **No cap** | Can achieve 10.0 |
| **55/45** | Near-perfect | **9.5 max** | v4.2 Enhanced |
| **60/40** | Slight off-center | **9.0 max** | Stricter than before |
| **65/35** | Moderate off-center | **9.0 max** | - |
| **70/30** | Noticeably off-center | **8.0 max** | - |
| **75/25** | Clear OC | **7.5 max** | - |
| **80/20** | Major OC | **6.0 max** | - |
| **>85/15** | Extreme OC | **≤4.0** | - |

**Key Rules:**
- Centering is evaluated on **both front and back independently**
- Each side uses its **worst axis** (left/right OR top/bottom)
- The centering cap applies even if all other categories are perfect

## 🔍 Defect Types & Point Deductions

### **Surface Defects**

| Defect Type | Penalty | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **White dots** | **−0.2 to −0.3** each | Small white specks (1-2mm) from print defects or debris |
| **Micro-scratches** | **−0.3 to −0.5** each | Hairline scratches visible under zoom or angled light |
| **Surface scratches** | **−0.5 to −1.0** each | Clearly visible scratches without magnification |
| **Roller lines** | **−0.3 to −0.5** | Faint parallel lines from manufacturing |
| **Print voids** | **−0.3 to −0.7** | Areas where ink didn't fully print |
| **Print lines** | **−0.3 to −0.5** | Lines from printing misalignment |
| **Compression marks** | **−0.5** | Indentations from stacking pressure |
| **Surface debris** | **−0.2 to −0.5** | Foreign material embedded in coating |
| **Holographic pattern disruption** | **−0.5 to −1.0** per area | Scratches through refractor/prizm pattern |

**Surface Severity Levels:**
- **Microscopic**: −0.2 to −0.3 (requires zoom but still visible)
- **Minor**: −0.5 to −0.7 (localized flaw, clearly visible)
- **Moderate**: −1.0 to −1.5 (noticeable without magnification)
- **Heavy**: −1.5 to −2.5 (major visible damage)

---

### **Corner Defects**

| Defect Type | Penalty | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **White fiber exposure** | **−0.5** per corner | ANY white showing at corner tip (most common defect) |
| **Corner softening** | **−0.5** per corner | Slight rounding, point not perfectly sharp |
| **Corner rounding** | **−1.0** per corner | Visible loss of corner point structure |
| **Corner whitening** | **−0.7 to −1.5** per corner | White cardstock visible from wear |

**Corner Examples:**
- **One corner** with minimal fiber: 10.0 − 0.5 = **9.5**
- **Two corners** with minimal fiber: 10.0 − 1.0 = **9.0**
- **Any corner** with visible rounding: 10.0 − 1.5+ = **8.5 maximum**

**Critical Rules:**
- Check **EVERY corner** independently (all 4)
- Even microscopic fiber exposure = automatic deduction
- Corner defects are **heavily weighted** in final grade

---

### **Edge Defects**

| Defect Type | Penalty | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **White flecks** | **−0.3** per fleck | Small spots of white fiber along edge (very common) |
| **Edge whitening** | **−0.7** per edge | Continuous white fiber visible along edge |
| **Edge roughness** | **−0.3 to −0.5** per edge | Factory cut not smooth (uneven edge) |
| **Edge chipping** | **−1.0 to −1.5** per chip | Material loss, divots in edge |
| **Print lines on edge** | **−0.3** | Colored lines from printing misalignment |

**Edge Examples:**
- **1-2 white flecks** on one edge: −0.3 per fleck
- **Continuous whitening** on one edge: −0.7
- **Multiple edges** with whitening: −1.0 to −1.5
- **Chipping** visible: −1.5 to −2.0

**Critical Rules:**
- **ANY white fleck visible = defect** (minimum −0.3)
- Scan **entire perimeter** of all 4 edges
- White flecks are extremely common manufacturing defects

## ⚙️ Scoring Methodology

### **Starting Point: 10.0**

Every card starts at a perfect **10.0** score and points are **deducted** for each defect found.

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Start at 10.0** for each category (Centering, Corners, Edges, Surface)

2. **Identify all defects** in each category

3. **Deduct points** based on defect severity:
   ```
   Example - Surface Category:
   Start: 10.0
   - 2 white dots: −0.3 each = −0.6
   - 1 micro-scratch: −0.3
   - 1 print line: −0.3
   = Surface Score: 10.0 − 1.2 = 8.8
   ```

4. **Apply multipliers** for multiple defects (v4.2 Enhancement):
   ```
   Multiple similar defects:
   - 1st defect: Base penalty
   - 2nd defect: Base × 1.25
   - 3rd defect: Base × 1.5

   Example - 3 scratches (base −0.5 each):
   • 1st scratch: −0.5
   • 2nd scratch: −0.5 × 1.25 = −0.625
   • 3rd scratch: −0.5 × 1.5 = −0.75
   Total: −1.875 (not −1.5)
   ```

5. **Apply clustering penalty** if defects are grouped in same area:
   - Add **−0.3** clustering penalty

6. **Apply centering cap** (if applicable):
   ```
   Example:
   All categories perfect (10.0), BUT centering is 60/40
   → Maximum grade capped at 9.0
   → Final grade: 9.0 (not 10.0)
   ```

7. **Calculate final grade using Weakest Link Method**

---

### **Weakest Link Scoring (CRITICAL)**

**The final grade is determined by the MINIMUM of all weighted category scores.**

**How it works:**

```
Example Card:
- Centering Score: 9.5 (front), 9.0 (back)
- Corners Score: 8.5 (worst corner limits this)
- Edges Score: 9.0
- Surface Score: 9.5

Weighted Minimum Calculation:
→ Worst category: Corners (8.5)
→ Check centering cap: 9.5/9.0 → No additional cap
→ Final Grade: 8.5 (limited by corners)
```

**This means:**
- Even if 3 categories are perfect (10.0), one bad category **pulls down the entire grade**
- A card with **one heavily rounded corner** (−1.5 = 8.5) cannot score above **8.5** overall
- Centering caps **override** all other scores

---

## 🎯 Perfect 10.0 Requirements

To receive a **10.0 Gem Mint** grade, ALL of the following must be true:

### **Centering:**
- [ ] Perfect **50/50** centering (or near-perfect 55/45 max)
- [ ] Both front AND back meet this requirement

### **Corners:**
- [ ] **ZERO fiber exposure** on any corner
- [ ] All 4 corners perfectly sharp
- [ ] No softening, rounding, or whitening

### **Edges:**
- [ ] **ZERO white flecks** anywhere on perimeter
- [ ] No edge whitening, roughness, or chipping
- [ ] Clean, smooth edges on all 4 sides

### **Surface:**
- [ ] **ZERO white dots** or debris
- [ ] **ZERO scratches** (even micro-scratches visible at zoom)
- [ ] **ZERO print defects** (lines, voids, roller marks)
- [ ] No compression marks or indentations
- [ ] Holographic cards: **ZERO pattern disruption**

**Critical Rule:**
🚨 **ANY visible defect = NOT 10.0**
🚨 When in doubt: Choose **9.5**, NOT 10.0

## 🆕 v4.2 Enhanced Strictness Features

The current grading system (v4.2) includes these enhanced features:

### **1. Stricter Perfect Score Gatekeeping**
- 10.0 grades must be **<1% of submissions**
- **No 10.0** with ANY visible defects (including microscopic)
- Prevents false 10.0 scores for cards with white dots, fiber exposure, or surface scratches

### **2. Improved Defect Detection Protocols**
- Mandatory checks for common defects:
  1. Corner fiber exposure (check ALL 4 corners)
  2. Edge white flecks (scan ENTIRE perimeter)
  3. Surface white dots (check entire surface area)
  4. Micro-scratches (examine at angles)
  5. Holographic pattern disruption (refractor/prizm cards)

### **3. Multiple Defect Multipliers**
- 2nd similar defect: **Base penalty × 1.25**
- 3rd similar defect: **Base penalty × 1.5**
- Prevents "bulk discount" on multiple defects

### **4. Stricter Centering Caps**
- **60/40 centering** now caps at **9.0** (was 9.5)
- **55/45 centering** now caps at **9.5** (new threshold)
- More realistic grade distribution

### **5. Weakest Link Scoring**
- Final grade = **minimum** of all weighted categories
- One weak category limits entire grade
- Prevents averaging out defects

## 🔧 Special Considerations

### **Holographic/Refractor/Prizm Cards**
- **ANY pattern disruption** = minimum **−0.5** deduction
- Scratches that disrupt rainbow pattern are **heavily penalized**
- Chrome/refractor finish shows **every scratch** more visibly

### **Front vs Back Scoring**
- Front and back are scored **independently**
- Each side gets its own centering evaluation
- Defects on back are equally important as front

### **Modern Card Features**
- Manufacturer variations (die-cut edges, textured surfaces) are considered
- Some features that look like defects are actually intentional (documented in evaluation)

### **Uncertainty and Conservative Defaults**
- When uncertain about defect severity: **Choose lower/safer grade**
- When uncertain about centering: **Apply cap conservatively**
- When uncertain if defect exists: **Document it as present** (safer interpretation)

---

## 📋 Quick Reference: Defect Severity Guide

### **Automatic 10.0 Disqualifiers:**
- ANY visible corner fiber
- ANY white fleck on edges
- ANY white dot on surface
- ANY scratch (even microscopic)
- ANY print defect
- Centering worse than 50/50 (or 55/45 at best)

### **Heavy Grade Limiters (≤9.0):**
- Corner rounding (−1.0 per corner)
- Edge chipping (−1.0 to −1.5)
- Continuous edge whitening (−0.7)
- Multiple surface scratches (−0.5+ each)
- Centering 60/40 or worse (cap 9.0)

### **Minor Issues (9.0-9.5 range):**
- Single white fleck (−0.3)
- Single white dot (−0.2 to −0.3)
- Minimal fiber exposure (−0.5 per corner)
- Micro-scratch (−0.3 to −0.5)
- Print line (−0.3 to −0.5)
